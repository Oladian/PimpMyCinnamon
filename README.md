# What is this script for?
This script automatically configurates the way I want my Linux Mint Cinnamon to look.
Tested on [Linux Mint Tessa Cinnamon](https://linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=261), but it should work in any distro running Cinnamon as the DE. 

## Resources used
The script download and install:
+ [Adapta-Nokto theme](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/themes/view/Adapta-Nokto)
+ [Papirus-Dark icon pack](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme)

## Config files

The script uses my personal terminal keybindings and menu configurations. Such files are located in the resources folder.
You can replace them for your own configuration files.

Also, you can decide whether or not you want to enable HiDPI scaling factor, useful for high-resolutions screens.
